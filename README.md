# Image Classification with Deep CNN (ResNet50) and Classic CNNs

Classic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as LeNet-5, and AlexNet, as well as a 50 layer deep CNN-ResNet50 were trained from the scratch to classify images of AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL). The dataset collected from Kaggle had variations of images in brightness, shifts, zoom, flips, backgrounds, angles and so on.  The trained model was good enough to classify our own custom images.

## Used Libraries:
* Data Analysis and Visualization: NumPy, cv2, Matplotlib 
* Machine Learning: Keras, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn

## Results:
All the implemented algorithms recognized the ASL letters with a validationaccuracy of more than 0.98 (>98%) for proper number of epochs.
