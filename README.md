# Image Classification with Deep CNN (ResNet50) and Conventional CNN

Classic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such asLeNet-5, andAlexNet,as well as a 50 layer deep CNN-ResNet50were trained from the scratchto classify images of AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL). The dataset collectedfrom Kaggle had variations of images in brightness, shifts, zoom, flips, backgrounds,angles and so on.  The trained model was good enough to classify our own customimages.

## Used Libraries:
* Data Analysis and Visualization: NumPy, cv2, Matplotlib 
* Machine Learning: Keras, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn

## Results:
All the implemented algorithms recognized the ASL letters with a validationaccuracy of more than 0.98 (>98%) for proper number of epochs.
